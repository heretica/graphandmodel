Mediation analysis studies how causes produce effects through intermediate variables (mediators).

## Framework

X → M → Y

- X: Treatment/exposure
- M: Mediator
- Y: Outcome

## Effects

- **Total Effect**: Overall effect of X on Y
- **Direct Effect**: Effect not through M
- **Indirect Effect**: Effect through M

## Applications

- Understanding causal mechanisms
- Intervention design
- Process evaluation
