Causal inference is the process of determining causal relationships from data.

## Core Challenges

- **Confounding**: Variables affecting both cause and effect
- **Selection Bias**: Non-random sample selection
- **Reverse Causation**: Effect influences the cause

## Methods

- [[Randomized Controlled Trial]]: Gold standard for causal inference
- [[Instrumental Variables]]: Using external instruments
- [[Propensity Score Matching]]: Balancing treatment groups
- [[Difference-in-Differences]]: Before-after comparisons
- [[Regression Discontinuity]]: Exploiting cutoff thresholds
