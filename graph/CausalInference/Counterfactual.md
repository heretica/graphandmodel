Counterfactuals are statements about what would have happened under different conditions.

## Definition

"What would Y have been, had X been x?"
Notation: Y_x or Y(x)

## Three Levels of Causation (Pearl's Ladder)

1. **Association**: P(Y|X) - observation
2. **Intervention**: P(Y|do(X)) - doing
3. **Counterfactual**: P(Y_x|X',Y') - imagining

## Applications

- Individual-level causal effects
- Fairness in machine learning
- Legal reasoning
- Policy analysis
