A Structural Causal Model (SCM) is a mathematical framework for representing and reasoning about causality. It combines:

- **Graphical Models**: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) representing causal relationships
- **Structural Equations**: Mathematical equations defining how variables relate
- **Interventions**: Formal operations modeling external manipulations
- **Counterfactual Reasoning**: Framework for "what if" questions

## Key Components

An SCM consists of:
1. Endogenous variables (affected by the model)
2. Exogenous variables (external influences)
3. Structural equations linking variables
4. A causal graph showing dependencies

## Framework

SCM = (U, V, F) where:
- U: Exogenous (background) variables
- V: Endogenous (observable) variables
- F: Set of structural equations

## Applications

- Policy evaluation and decision making
- Root cause analysis
- Mediation and moderation analysis
- Fairness assessment in AI systems
