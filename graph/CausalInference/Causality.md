Causality is the relationship between causes and effects. In the context of causal inference:

- **Causal Relationship**: X causes Y if changing X leads to changes in Y
- **Correlation vs Causation**: Correlation does not imply causation
- **Counterfactual Definition**: X caused Y if Y would not have occurred without X

## Frameworks

- [[Structural Causal Model]]: Pearl's graphical approach
- [[Rubin Causal Model]]: Potential outcomes framework
- [[Granger Causality]]: Time-series causality
